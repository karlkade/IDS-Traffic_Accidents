# Traffic Accidents in Estonia between 2011-2021

Authors: Karl Arthur Kade, Aaron Anders Jaani, Mihkel Kulu

### The challange
Leverage 10 years of data on traffic accidents involving casualties to identify actionable insights for enhancing road safety. 

### Vision
Transform raw data into meaningful insights to uncover hidden patterns.

### Guide
The repository contains:
1. **`src/D5Project.ipynb`**: 
   - A Jupyter Notebook that includes all steps of the analysis:
     - Data loading and preprocessing.
     - Statistical analysis.
     - Visualizations of key patterns.

### Replication Steps
1. Ensure Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook are installed (refer to the [official guide](https://jupyter.org/install)).
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Download the processed dataset file Liiklus√µnnetused_2011_2021.csv from (refer to the [Eesti Avaandmed](https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/datasets/inimkannatanutega-liiklusonnetuste-andmed)) and place it in the same directory as the notebook, or update the file path in the code accordingly.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`D5Project.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
5. Run the first cell to install any required libraries.
6. Execute all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
